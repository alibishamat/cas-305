## Artemis Financial Security Enhancement Project

Artemis Financial is a mid-sized financial services company specializing in investment management and financial planning. The client required a comprehensive assessment and mitigation of software security vulnerabilities in their client-facing application to safeguard sensitive financial data and maintain regulatory compliance.

The company faced potential risks from outdated security practices, including weak authentication mechanisms and vulnerabilities in input validation. My task was to identify and address these vulnerabilities to ensure the software application met modern security standards.

### Recommended Encryption Algorithm
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) was chosen as the encryption algorithm for its security and efficiency. AES encrypts data in 128-bit blocks and supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits. Using AES-256 provided strong protection against brute-force and cryptanalytic attacks, including future quantum computing threats. Secure random number generators were used for initialization vectors (IVs) to ensure unpredictability and prevent replay attacks.

### Secure Communication Implementation
To secure the communication channel, HTTPS was implemented with SSL/TLS encryption. This ensured data integrity and confidentiality during transmission. The keystore setup was validated to support SSL/TLS configurations, and dependency-check reports were generated to address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries, such as Log4j and Jackson. These updates reduced the application's attack surface and strengthened its security posture.

One of my key achievements was conducting a thorough vulnerability assessment, identifying areas such as SQL injection risks and insecure API endpoints. Addressing these vulnerabilities required a meticulous approach to refactoring code and implementing secure coding practices, such as parameterized queries and robust input validation.

Secure coding is vital because it prevents unauthorized access, protects sensitive data, and ensures user trust. For Artemis Financial, these improvements provided enhanced protection against data breaches and helped build a reputation for reliability and security.

The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was prioritizing issues based on potential impact. Using tools like OWASP ZAP and manual code reviews, I identified high-priority vulnerabilities and tackled them systematically. Collaboration with stakeholders helped clarify security requirements and ensure alignment with the client’s objectives.

### Added Layers of Security
To increase security, I implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA), encrypted data transmissions using TLS, and improved session management practices. Input validation techniques were reinforced to protect against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). These measures enhanced both the application’s security and user experience.

After refactoring the code, I conducted rigorous testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and penetration tests, to ensure the application remained functional and secure. Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines included automated security scans to detect any new vulnerabilities introduced during development.

### Key Tools and Best Practices
Key tools and practices included:
- OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning
- Burp Suite for penetration testing
- AES encryption for secure data handling
- Secure coding guidelines from OWASP and NIST
- Peer code reviews and pair programming to enhance code quality

To mitigate known security vulnerabilities, the following best practices were adopted:
- Secure Communication via HTTPS
- Robust Key Management
- Dependency Management and Security Headers
- Secure Configuration Settings

These resources will be invaluable for future tasks requiring secure software development.

### Summary and Impact
This project demonstrated my ability to assess and mitigate security vulnerabilities, implement secure coding practices, and ensure application reliability. The refactored code tackled significant security issues, focusing on HTTPS implementation, safe key management, and dependency updates. Static security testing tools like Maven Dependency-Check were instrumental in identifying and resolving vulnerabilities. By applying industry-standard best practices, the application’s security posture was improved, contributing to Artemis Financial’s overall security and client trust.

For future employers, I would highlight this assignment as evidence of my expertise in secure software development and my commitment to delivering reliable, high-quality solutions. This project not only improved Artemis Financial’s application security but also reinforced my skills in identifying and resolving software vulnerabilities. It was a valuable learning experience that emphasized the importance of secure coding and thorough testing in maintaining software integrity and client trust.
